<span style="float: right;"><strong>1-26</strong></span></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This article looks back upon the past and the current status of Hangul TeX system, and tries to take a view on the future of the Hangul TeX. Specifically, we will look into a set of required features of Hangul TeX system by describing the tasks that ko.TeX has faced and tackled. Our focus will be laid on the issues regarding implementing proper Hangul typography as well as basic typesetting of Hangul characters.</p>

<span style="float: right;"><strong>51-79</strong></span></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In this paper, we look into the definition and the components of a book which is the final product of publishing. We also introduce the roles that TeX can play in the various stages of producing a book, and describe the strength and weakness of TeX as a typesetting system compared to other systems. The methods of implementing essential typographical elements including book size, page layout, font selection, line and character spacing settings, and paragraph justification are also shown together with practical examples.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em; float: left;">by Shinsaku Fujita</span>
<span style="float: right;"><strong>89-108</strong></span></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Preparation methods of chemical documents containing chemical structural formulas have been surveyed by referring to the author's experiences of publishing books, emphasizing differences before and after the adoption of TeX/LaTeX-typesetting as well as before and after the development of XyMTeX. The recognition of XyMTeX commands as linear notations has led to the concept of the XyM notation, which has further grown into XyMML (XyM Markup Language) as a markup language for characterizing chemical structural formulas. XML (Extensible Markup Language) documents with XyMML are converted into HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents with XyM notations, which are able to display chemical structural formulas in the Internet by means of the XyMJava system developed as a Java applet of an internet browser. On the other hand, the same XML documents with XyMML are converted into LaTeX documents with XyMTeX commands (the same as XyM notations), which are able to print out chemical structural formulas of high quality. Functions added by the latest version (4.04) of XyMTeX have enhanced abilities of drawing complicated structures such as steroids. LaTeX documents with XyMTeX formulas can be converted into PDF (Portable Document Format) documents directly or via PostScript document. Applications of such PDF documents in online or semi-online submission to scientific journals have been discussed.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Many people start to prepare their slides before identifying their core messages which should be extracted from what they want to talk about. Thus the resulting presentations fail to attract much attention. To avoid this mistake, I apply the "Rule of Three" to all my slides, in each of which I place certain key phrases including my three core messages. These additional editing tasks are performed semi-automatically with the aid of the programming functions of LaTeX and scripting language. My motivation for developing this system is to acquire a sincere attitude towards my audience through Kata, an essential concept in the process by which traditional Japanese culture is passed on.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em; float: left;">by Yoshihisa Nagata</span>
<span style="float: right;"><strong>119-123</strong></span></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The online publishing potential of LaTeX offers a possible solution to the problem of access to old and rare books. This paper demonstrates how LaTeX could be applied to rare editions of the nineteenth century "Grimms Fairy Tales." Attention is drawn to the ability of LaTeX to accommodate Old German scripts, and by extension, other archaic typefaces in its font selection scheme. A <tt>khm</tt> package that I developed myself by integrating developments of Daniel Taupin, Walter Schmidt and Torsten Bronger is introduced, outlining its ease of use and range of option selections.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em; float: left;">by Satoshi Hagihira</span>
<span style="float: right;"><strong>125-131</strong></span></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>BibTeX is a powerful tool to building reference lists from a bibliography database. Because the bibliography styling varies so widely among journals, a bibliography style file, capable of creating a list that exactly meets the requirements of a target journal, may not always be available. Since manually editing a BibTeX style file to ensure compatibility is troublesome and prone to error, I developed cbst, a tool that employs shell scripting and gawk scripts to customize BibTeX style files. Using cbst, it is possible to easily generate bibliographies that conform with the style of most target journal.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em; float: left;">by Tomohiko Morioka (守岡 知彦)</span>
<span style="float: right;"><strong>133-139</strong></span></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This paper describes typesetting of "Annual Bibliography of Oriental Studies" (「東洋學文獻類目」; ABOS) as a case study of multilingual typesetting. ABOS is a multilingual bibliography of oriental studies, including various languages and scripts such as Japanese, Chinese, Korean, English, French, German, Russian, other European languages, Vietnamese, Thai, Latin transcriptions of Sanskrit, Tibetan, Arabic, etc., IPA phonetic symbols, Ancient Chinese scripts such as Oracle-Bone inscriptions (甲骨文字), Bronze inscriptions (金文), Chu bamboo scripts (楚簡文字) and their modern transcriptions (隷定文字), etc. Most of characters included in ABOS are included in UCS, however some characters/scripts are missing, for example Oracle-Bone script, other ancient Chinese scripts and their modern transcriptions. This paper describes the current typesetting system based on upLaTeX briefly.</p>
